~~كان هذا هو الإسلام اذن فنحن جميعا مسلمون!! جوته ( الديوان الشرقي للمؤلف
~~الغربي ) منذ قرون عدة رسم الغرب صورة ذهنية معنوية سيئة عن العرب،
~~والإسلام وجعلها محكومة بنمطية ثابتة، ولا يقبل تعديلها ولكن فى ظل الأحداث
~~الجارية بدأ ينصب الاهتمام حول علاقة الشرق بالغرب، أو بعبارة أدق: علاقة
~~الغرب بالاسلام، وأصبح الجميع فى الغرب يهرولون لدراسة المزيد عن الاسلام
~~والمسلمين سواء فى الدين أو الفكر أو الشريعة الخ وهذا فرض علينا نحن أهل
~~الشرق والإسلام أن نوضح لهم الصورة النقية الصافية لهذا الدين العالمى ،
~~وضرورة إبراز دعوة الإسلام إلى السلم لا التسليم ، ورفضه كل أشكال الإرهاب
~~(الغربية قبل الشرقية)، واستعداده للدخول في أي مسعى يهدف إلى مكافحة
~~الظلم، شريطة أن تضطلع به أيد نظيفة غير ملوثة بممارسة الظلم والقهر
~~والعدوان والتطهير العرقي والنفى من الأوطان !! وسوف نبرز آراء بعض من
~~مفكرى الغرب فى الإسلام(1) قال المسيو واميري المجري : " إني أعتقد في
~~الحقيقة أن روح نظام المسلمين دين الإسلام , وهو الذي أحياهم, والذي يتكفل
~~لهم بالسلامة, إنما هو الإسلام فقط " وقال المسيو بيرك في البرلمان
~~الانجليزي : " إن دين الإسلام, هو أحكم وأعقل وأرحم تشريع عرفه التاريخ
~~البشري " وقال شارل ميزميز الفرنسي المعروف : " لو وجد دين الاسلام
~~المبلغين المقتدرين , الذين يقدرون المذاكرة والتفاهم مع علماء النصارى في
~~هذه الأزمنة التي تنتشر فيها مذاهب الضلالة المتفرقة, لأسلم الناس في أوربا

# " ألم يأن لنا أن نعترف - نحن الذين نعد أنفسنا في أعلى قمة التهذيب -
~~بأنه لولا التهذيب الاسلامي , ومدنية المسلمين وعلومهم وعظمتهم, وحسن نظام
~~جامعاتهم, لكانت أوربا اليوم تهيم في ظلام ليل بهيم ألا يمكن أن يقال حقا :
~~إن أوربا المسيحية بذلت كل في بوسعها منذ قرون لتخفي شكرها للعرب المسلمين
~~! دع أوربا تعترف بخطئها, دعها تعلن للعالم أجمع عن غباوتها الغريزية أنها

# they assumed the caliphate following the umayyads. they trace their
~~lineage to al-`abbas, the prophet's uncle. after half a century of
~~secret arrangements, the abbasid revolution began in khurasan under the
~~leadership of abu muslim al-khurasani, 130 a.h./748 a.d. during their
~~rule the muslim empire reached its zenith in all aspects of life. their
~~first caliph was abu al-`abbas al-saffah. he was followed by abu ja`far
~~al-mansur who ended the revolutionary period, reaffirmed their rule and
~~established baghdad, the capital, which witnessed a scientific, cultural
~~and literary renaissance that stretched throughout the middle centuries.
~~unfortunately, the state eventually began to decline and suffer from
~~weakness and decentralization. many petty states emerged such as the
~~tulunids, the ikhshidids and the fatimids. the mongols destroyed the
~~abbasid caliphate and al-musta`sim, the last caliph, was killed by
~~hulegu. --- abbey الرهبانية abbot الراهب abdication التنحى عن العرش ---
~~‘abdul muttalib عبد المطلب ‘abdul muttalib was the nickname of the
~~grandfather of muhammad s. PageV01P0003
# hashim bin 'abd manaf, the great-grandfather of muhammad s was the
~~chief of makkah and also a caretaker of the ka’bah. through his trading
~~caravans, he had brought prosperity to makkah. he had made makkah the
~~trading capital of arabia. during one of his business trips, caravan of
~~hashim bin 'abd manaf stopped at yathrib (madinah). there, he married
~~salma bint ‘amr of the local najjar tribe. a few days after his
~~marriage, hashim bin 'abd manaf continued on his business trip. during
~~that journey, he fell sick and died of his illness. his fellow travelers
~~buried him in ghaza. a few months after the death of hashim bin 'abd
~~manaf, his widow salma gave birth to his son. that boy was named ‘amr
~~bin hashim, but everyone called him shaybah (old man) because he had a
~~bunch of white hair at birth. back in makkah, al muttalib bin 'abd
~~manaf, a younger brother of hashim bin 'abd manaf assumed the
~~responsibilities of the offices of the ka'bah after him. by chance, al
~~muttalib bin 'abd manaf found out that his nephew, son of his elder
~~brother hashim bin 'abd manaf, was growing up in yathrib (madinah) with
~~his mother and maternal uncles. al muttalib bin 'abd manaf decided to
~~return the wealth of hashim bin 'abd manaf to his son shaybah.
~~PageV01P0004
# al muttalib bin 'abd manaf traveled to yathrib (madinah) to bring his
~~nephew back to makkah. after initial hesitation salma agreed to send her
~~son to makkah with his uncle al muttalib bin 'abd manaf. on their way to
~~makkah, shaybah was riding ahead of al muttalib bin 'abd manaf. in those
~~days, usually servants rode ahead of their masters. when people of
~~makkah saw shaybah riding ahead of al muttalib, they mistook him as a
~~servant of al muttalib. that is why they called him 'abdul muttalib,
~~which means the servant of al muttalib. this nickname became so popular
~~that his real name ‘amr bin hashim or his nickname shaybah, was
~~completely forgotten. with time 'abdul muttalib became the chief of
~~makkah and the caretaker of the ka’bah. he inherited the responsibility
~~to provide drinking water to the pilgrims of the ka’bah. fetching water
~~all day long from distant wells made him very tired. by chance he
~~discovered the long-lost zamzam well. muhammad s was the son of ‘abdul
~~muttalib’s youngest son ‘abdullah. muhammad s was born a few months
~~after the death of his father. ‘abdul muttalib loved his grandson
~~muhammad s very much. 'abdul muttalib died when muhammad s was only
~~eight year old. --- abdullah / ‘abd allah عبد الله PageV01P0005
# after the advent of islam, ‘abd allah became one of the most popular
~~names. it means slave of allah. rules of arabic language grammar allow
~~the two words to be combined together. after joining together, words
~~‘abd and allah can be written as ‘abdullah or ‘abdallah. arabs worshiped
~~allah in the days of ignorance also, but they took many partners with
~~him. they mistakenly considered allah as the biggest of their many gods.
~~the name ‘abd allah was in use among arabs before islam also. father of
~~muhammad s was also named ‘abdullah. he had died a few months before
~~muhammad s was born.‘abdullah bin ‘abdul muttalib was the name of the
~~father of muhammad s. he was the youngest son of ‘abdul muttalib.

~~abraham, moses, david and jesus no longer exist in their original form.
~~we believe only in the original taurat (torah), zaboor (psalms) and

~~الحج "the pilgrimage", which commences on the 8th of dhu'l-hijjah. there
~~are three types of hajj: hajjat-tamata'a (interrupted). umra followed by
~~hajj, but taking off the ihram in between these two stages. hajj al-
~~qiran (combined). umra then hajj without taking off the ihram. hajj al-
~~ifrad (single). hajj without umra. a pilgrimage to makkah in the twelfth
~~month of the islamic calendar is also known as hajj al-ifrad. the
~~performance of hajj consists of ten steps: put on the ihram at the
~~appointed station, then recite the talbiyah. recitation is done aloud by
~~men and quietly by women. depending on what type of hajj you are doing,
~~perform the necessary rites at the ka'aba on arrival in makkah.
~~seetalbiya. go to mina (on the 8th of the month). pray the duhr, 'asr,
~~maghreb, isha and fajr prayers at their proper times, but shortening the
~~four rak'at to two, as if doing travelling prayers. when the sun rises
~~(on the 9th of the month), go to 'arafat and combine the duhr and 'asr
~~salat. after the sun sets, go to al-muzdallifa, reciting the talbiyah.
~~combine the maghreb and the 'isha salat. after the fajr prayer, raise
~~your hands and do du'a. (after midnight, women and the weak may proceed
~~to mina if they wish.) PageV01P0053
# in muzdallifa (or mina), pick up small stones (either 49 or 70) to
~~throw at the jamra (stone pillars) of 'aqaba. go to mina (on the 10th of
~~the month); throw seven stones, one stone at a time, at the largest of
~~the three jamras (the stone pillars that represent shaitan). sacrifice
~~your animal. you must eat some of its meat, but give the bulk of it to
~~the poor and hungry. (do this step only if it is required of you. it is
~~not required for hajj al-ifrad. if you are doing either of the other two
~~types of hajj, but cannot afford an animal, then fast three days after
~~you first put on ihram and seven days after you have returned home.)
~~shave your head. women only need to cut off a lock of hair. the rules of
~~ihram are now lifted, except for sexual intercourse with one's spouse.
~~go to makkah and do tawaf al-ifada. go to the hills of safa and marwa
~~and do sa'i. now the rules of ihram are completely lifted. return to
~~mina and stay there for the remainder of the 10th and on the 11th, 12th
~~and the 13th. (you may, if you wish, leave mina after asr on the 12th or
~~after asr on the 13th. you must leave mina before the sun sets.) each
~~day, stone each of the three jamras (the stone pillars) with seven
~~pebbles. if you wish to return home, you must do the tawaf al-wida'. no-
~~one is excused, except for menstruating women or women in the period of

~~which allah has stated in his book (the qur'ân) or mentioned through his
~~messenger (muhammad saw ) without changing them or ignoring them
~~completely or twisting the meanings or giving resemblance to any of the
~~created things; e.g. allah is present over his throne as mentioned in
~~the qur'ân. (v. 20 : 5): "the most beneficent (i.e. allah) istawa (rose
~~over) the (mighty) throne" over the seventh heaven; and he only comes
~~down over the first (nearest) heaven (to us) during the day of 'arafât
~~(hajj, i.e. 9th dhul-hijja) and also during the last third part of the

~~knowledge only, not by his personal self (bi-dhatihi), "there is nothing
~~like unto him, and he is the all-hearer, the all-seer." (the qur'ân, v.
~~42:11). this holy verse confirms the quality of hearing and the quality

# "to one whom i have created with both my hands," (v. 38:75); and he

~~conception, tawheed can be viewed from four distinct perspectives:

~~one lord, the master and creator of the universe, who oversees and
~~orders it in every moment, and that he is allah subhana wa ta'ala.
~~tawheed ai-uluhiyah : unity of worship. to realise that none has the
~~right to be worshipped but allah "wahdahu ia shareeka'lah" ("alone
~~without partner"). tawheed al-asma wa sifaat : unity of names and
~~attributes of allah ta'ala. to comprehend that: none can qualify or name
~~allah except as he or muhammad, may allah bless him and grant him peace,
~~have named or qualified him. none can be named or qualified with the
~~names or the attributes that belong only to allah subhana wa ta'ala. for
~~example, none maybe called "ai-muhyee" ("the giver of life") except
~~allah subhana wa ta'ala himself. we must accept all the ayat and
~~ahadeeth (sahih)regarding the attributes of allah without altering their
~~meaning in any way whatsoever. for a full list of the attributes of

~~'judahite' was shortened to 'judean', which was then eventually
~~shortened to 'jew'. the judahite jews re-wrote and altered the torah
~~several times and formulated the talmud (incorporating the mishnah, the
~~jerusalem gemara, the babylonian gemara and the midrash), and their
~~religion became known as judaism. 'yahoud' is the arabic equivalent of

~~are descended from the turkic russian tribe of the khazars who embraced
~~judaism in the seventh century, but who were not originally descended
~~from any of the twelve tribes of israel. it is for this reason that some

~~magog, (since they are 'jews', but not judahite jews), about whom it is
~~prophesied in ezekiel 38-39 that they will come from their place in the
